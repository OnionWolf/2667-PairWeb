		<h1>Healthy Campus Team</h1>
		  	<p>The Healthy Campus Team in Wellness Services is dedicated to health promotion, which is understood as "the process of enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants and thereby improve their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual behaviour towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions." (WHO, 2005).</p>
			<p>We work with campus community members to help promote well-being from the individual to the environmental level. We do this collaboratively through an evidence-based population health promotion approach that includes identifying health issues and strategically engaging in programming, education, advocacy, capacity building, and policy initiatives.</p>
			<p>To learn more about health promotion at universities and colleges, please see the Okanagan International Charter for Health Promoting Universities and Colleges (2015), of which Mount Royal is a proud signatory.</p>
		
		<h1>Health Promotion Initiatives</h1>
      		<p>A critical aspect of the work we do involves gathering information from students in order to inform our health promotion initiatives. We strive to be responsive to the needs of our community and these surveys and consultations allow us to learn about the concerns and subjects that are impacting students.</p>
		
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">National College Health Assessment</h4>
			<p>The National College Health Assessment (NCHA) is an online survey that collects information about students' habits, behaviours, and perceptions on health topics. It is valid and reliable. Because it is used by many post-secondary institutions across the country, Mount Royal can compare itself to a "Canadian average." The survey is sent out every 3 years and was last administered in the winter of 2019. To request a presentation of the most recent data for your department or class please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWNeWuOMdm5uoZDbRvAOZ8T99f3PBSgZ_m-lmVllsq7k4REQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">fill out this form.</a></p>
		
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Student Consultations</h4>
			<p>In the fall of 2017, we completed student consultations to learn more about student wellness on campus. This process began with a survey distributed in November 2017. Based on what we learned through the survey, we conducted 12 focus groups to gather more details about the sorts of services and supports students are looking for. The results of this process will be used to inform our programming and initiatives and how we communicate with students. They are also being shared widely with other stakeholders on campus.</p>
		
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Well-being in the Learning Environment</h4>
			<p>During the 2018 Winter semester, Wellness Services collaborated with Nursing 2216 students to help them fulfill the requirements of their community health practicum placement. In response to NCHA data, the topic chosen was "well-being in the learning environment". The goal was to explore the conditions required for students to feel engaged in the classroom, which ultimately positively contributes to their overall mental health.</p>
			<p>Preliminary data for this topic already existed as a result of Wellness Services' previous engagements with students. These preliminary findings were used to create a survey that was distributed to faculty who had been recognized by students for effectively incorporating elements of well-being into their classrooms. The faculty members were also asked to participate in an interview to further explore their perspectives on this topic.</p>
			<p>Overall, 27 Mount Royal faculty members completed this survey, with 13 of them agreeing to participate in an additional interview. Some themes that emerged were flexibility, social connection, participation, safety and support, reflection, a welcoming environment and self-care.</p>
			<p>As a next step, Wellness Services partnered again with Nursing 2216 practicum students in the Spring 2018 semester. A combined student-faculty consultation session ran in May 2018 to validate some of the initial findings. </p>
		
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Steps to Well-being</h4>
		<p><strong>Steps to Well-Being offers students the opportunity to get active!</strong></p>
			<p>This program is designed to improve students' health by building confidence, community, better health habits, as well as to reduce levels of stress. It also helps students navigate service offerings available on and off campus with regard to their overall wellness. Also, the program sets the foundation to help students build positive physical activity habits that they can maintain moving forward.</p>
			<p>Once you are a part of the program, you will receive five free personal training sessions at the MRU Recreation facility. Also, a complimentary wellness kit full of resources and tools to help kick-start your activity journey!</p>
			<p>Visit U216 to determine your eligibility to take part in the program. There are limited spots available and, spots fill up on a first-come-first-served basis. For more information, please email: stepstowellbeing@mtroyal.ca. </p>
		
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Policy and Harm Reduction</h4>
			<p>The Healthy Campus Team operates with a harm reduction lens, which means that our number one priority is keeping people in our campus community safe. It also means we recognize that some people are going to use substances like drugs and alcohol and we want to make sure everyone has the education and resources to be safe. We also provide information and support services to people who want to reduce or stop using substances.</p>
			<p>Less than half of Mount Royal students know where to go if they are concerned about their own, or a friend's, use of substances. Please visit or call Wellness Services for more information. </p>
