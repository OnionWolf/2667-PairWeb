      	<p>Student Counselling Services is for MRU students. We offer individual counselling and workshops at no charge. Alumni may have one appointment post-graduation with a focus on how to access off-campus resources. We are committed to providing students with ongoing care and are offering telephone and video sessions. </p>
		<p>To discuss your options or to book, change, or cancel an appointment, please email <strong>counselling@mtroyal.ca</strong>. Be sure to include your name and a call-back number. An administrative assistant will call you back as soon as possible. We have walk-in services Monday to Friday, 1 p.m. - 4 p.m. Although these operate on a first-come first-served basis, we will make room for students in crisis.</p>
	  	<p>Most students attend 3-4 sessions, and this is enough to help them move towards the goals they establish with their counsellor. The actual number of sessions is determined by a student's needs and available resources. Counselling sessions and counseling records are confidential.</p>
