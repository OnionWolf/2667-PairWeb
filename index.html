	  <h2>Mental Health Resource Guide</h2>
      	<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>The resource guide is intended to serve as an introduction to the Mental Health resources available to students at Mount Royal University and provide a quick reference for students to access information about those services. This webpage is intended to serve as a general source of information for students on and off campus in maintaining their mental and physical health while they pursue their education at MRU</p>
      		<p>Mental health is essential to your well-being and academic success. Many people are affected by mental health issues such as depression or panic disorders. These issues can make it harder to think clearly, manage how you feel, and work with other people. Sometimes you may feel helpless and hopeless. But you're not alone. Talking with others who suffer from these issues may help. And treatment can help you get back in control. Or maybe you're worried about someone else and want to help. This guide will present a variety of mental health resources within Mount Royal University and Calgary.</p>
	  		<p>Mental health is not the mere absence of illness, it is the ability to participate meaningfully in one’s community, to engage effectively in the world, and develop meaning and purpose in one’s life.</p>
	  		<p>Mental health can be defined as: “The capacities of each and all of us to feel, think, and act in ways that enhance our ability to enjoy life and deal with the challenges we face. It is a positive sense of emotional and spiritual well-being that respects the importance of culture, equity, social justice, interconnections, and personal dignity” (Government of Canada, 2006).
	  		</p>
	  		<p>This definition of mental health is aligned with concepts of mental health identified by the World Health Organization (2001) as well as Corey Keyes (2002) description of ‘flourishing.’ Keyes conceptualizes health and illness as separate continuums wherein a student with mental illness may flourish and conversely, someone without mental illness may languish with less than optimal health.</p>
		<h1>Common Mental Health Questions</h1>
			<h4>Can I see a clinic physician on campus if I have another family doctor elsewhere?</h4>
				<p>While you are a student or employee at Mount Royal, you can access services in the Health Services clinic. However, we strongly encourage students to continue to work with their family physician when their medical care is ongoing or complex in nature. This is important for continuity of care.</p>
			<h4>Can my family come and see a physician in an emergency like a walk-in clinic?</h4>
				<p>No. Medical services are offered to credit students (including occupational programs in Continuing Education) and employee members of the MRSA/MRFA. Family members of the students in the Indigenous Family Housing program also have access to Health Services.</p>
			<h4>Are there lab services or X-ray services?</h4>
				<p>There are no lab nor X-ray services on campus. However, our clinic physicians can provide a medical requisition for these services if needed.<br> Please <a href="servicesBook.html">book an appointment</a>.</p>
			<h4>Can I get a medical note from Health Services for an exam deferral or withdrawal?</h4>
				<p>Mount Royal students enrolled in credit courses can seek medical documentation to support a Deferred Examination or Withdrawal with Cause. It is important that you seek the required medical documentation from a healthcare practitioner who is familiar with your medical history. See the <a href="https://www.mtroyal.ca/AcademicSupport/AcademicCalendar/index.htm">Academic Calendar</a> for full details.</p>
			<h4>Do you have the emergency contraceptive pill?</h4>
				<p>Health Services offers Plan B for emergency contraception. Please <a href="servicesBook.html">book an appointment</a> with a physician as soon as possible. There is a $10 fee for the medication.</p>

		<h4>Importance of Mental Health</h4>
	  		<p>Mental health is essential to students’ academic success as well as their ability to participate fully and meaningfully throughout all aspects of their lives and throughout their lifespan.
	  		</p>
	  		<p>Empowering students to participate actively in maintaining their well-being as well as addressing mental health issues sets the foundation for increased ability to sustain wellbeing throughout their lives.
	  		</p>
	  		<p>Addressing discrimination and inequities is essential to both student mental health and learning.
				</p>
	  			<p>Physical, cultural, spiritual, political, socioeconomic, and organizational contextual factors are all interrelated and significantly impact the student learning experience and wellbeing (Silverman, Underhile & Keeling, 2008)
