		<h2>supporting yourself & others</h2>
     	 <p>Respecting yourself is an important part of good mental health. Try to remember that there is nothing to feel ashamed of if you are struggling. You can reach goals that are important to you even if you have a mental health problem. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help in these situations and remember that it is okay to use therapy and medication in order to live a more stable and happy life. Your mental health is just as important as health in the rest of your body. </p>
      <h1>Self-Management</h1>
		<p>Whenever you are having trouble with thinking negative thoughts, expecting the worst, or feeling powerless, try any of these exercises for a few days:</p>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Focus on what is going well</h4>
			<p>Write down three things that have gone well in the past day. These can be large, like getting a raise, or small, like "I talked with an old friend today." Describe the cause of each event, and credit yourself for the part you played in it, such as "I made that phone call I've been putting off for a long time."</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Practice gratitude</h4>
			<p>Write down three things in your life that you are grateful for. This kind of focus on what enriches your life can help keep your thoughts and feelings more positive</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Look for the benefits. </h4>
			<p>Think of a negative event from your near or distant past. Write it down. Now think of something positive that has or could come of it. Write it down. For the positive thought, use larger handwriting or a favourite colour.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Look ahead</h4>
			<p>Picture yourself doing something that feels good. Expect good things to happen.</p>
		<hr>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Build yourself up - do not be afraid to ask for help. </h4>
			<p>When you need it, lean on others or your faith to build more strength. Say to yourself often, "I am strong." If you feel you need someone to talk to immediately, visit chapter 3 | Crisis Resources of this document for mental health helplines, or talk with someone in your life that you trust.</p>
			<p>Your attitude and actions can influence what others think. Be honest with people and show them who you really are. When you help people understand your mental health problem, they are more likely to get past their negative views.</p>
			<p>Here are some ways you can help others better understand mental health problems:</p>
				<ul>				
					<li>Let them know that your mental health problem is a medical problem that can be treated.</li>
					<li>Talk about your recovery. This will help them understand the challenges you face.</li>
					<li>Show them your strengths and talents. Don't let your mental health problem keep you from going after things you want to do.</li>
					<li>Remember that "you are the message." You can show how you want to be treated by the way you act. Treating yourself with respect can set an example for everyone.</li>
					<li>Accept that you may need breaks during activities. Your symptoms may make it harder to focus on things for a long time.</li>
					<li>Work with your family and doctor to set goals you can reach. Let them know what changes you want to make in your life.</li>
				</ul>
			<hr>
		<h1>Coping with Stress</h1>
			<p>Stress is what you feel when you must handle more than you are used to. Some stress is normal and even useful. Stress can help if you need to work hard or react quickly. But if stress happens too often or lasts too long, it can have bad effects. It can be linked to headaches, an upset stomach, back pain, and trouble sleeping. It can weaken your immune system, making it harder to fight off disease. If you already have a health problem, stress may make it worse. It can make you moody, tense, or depressed. Your relationships may suffer, and you may not do well at work or school. </p>
			<p>It is important to figure out what causes stress for you. Everyone feels and responds to stress differently. Stress is a fact of life for most people. You may not be able to get rid of stress, but you can look for ways to lower it.</p>
			<ul class="list-group border= 1 px">
				<p class="list-group-item font-weight-bold">You might try some of these ideas:</p>
				<li class="list-group-item">Get involved in social groups, or volunteer to help others. Being alone can make things seem worse than they are.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Look at how you have been dealing with stress. Be honest about what works and what does not. Think about other things that might work better.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Take good care of yourself. Get plenty of rest. Eat well. Don't smoke. Limit how much alcohol you drink.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Ask for help. People who have a strong network of family and friends manage stress better.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Exercise. Regular exercise is one of the best ways to manage stress. Walking is a great way to get started.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Learn ways to relax your body. This can include breathing exercises, muscle relaxation exercises, massage, aromatherapy, yoga, or relaxing exercises like tai chi and qi gong.</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Let your feelings out. Talk, laugh, cry, and express anger when you need to with someone you trust.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Factors Affecting Stress</h4>
				<h4>Anxiety</h4>
					<p>Feeling worried or nervous is a normal part of everyday life. Everyone frets or feels anxious from time to time. Mild to moderate anxiety can help you focus your attention, energy, and motivation. Overwhelming anxiety that interferes with daily life is not normal. This type of anxiety may be a symptom of generalized anxiety disorder, or it may be a symptom of another problem, such as depression. Anxiety can cause physical and emotional symptoms. A specific situation or fear can cause some or all of these symptoms for a short time.</p>
					<p>Physical symptoms of anxiety include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Trembling, twitching, or shaking</li>
						<li>Breathlessness or rapid heartbeat</li>
						<li>Sweating</li>
						<li>Muscle tension, aches or soreness</li>
						<li>Extreme fatigue</li>
						<li>Sleep problems, such as restlessness or early waking</li>
					</ul>
				<h4>Depression</h4>
					<p>Depression is an illness that causes you to feel sad, lose interest in activities that you've always enjoyed, withdraw from others, and have little energy. It's different from normal feelings of sadness, grief, or low energy. Depression can also cause people to feel hopeless about the future and even think about suicide. The symptoms of depression may be hard to notice at first. They vary among people, and you may confuse them with just feeling "off" or with another health problem. </p>
					<p>The two most common symptoms of depression are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Feeling sad or hopeless nearly every day for at least 2 weeks.</li>
						<li>Losing interest in or not getting pleasure from most daily activities that you used to enjoy and feeling this way nearly every day for at least 2 weeks.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Depression can be treated in various ways. Counselling, psychotherapy, and antidepressant medicines can all be used. Lifestyle changes, such as getting more exercise, also may help. Work with your health care team to find the best treatment for you. It may take a few tries, and it can take several weeks for the medicine and therapy to start working. Try to be patient and keep following your treatment plan.</p>
				<h4>Insomnia</h4>
					<p>Insomnia is a common sleep problem that can affect your quality of life. People with insomnia have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. They may wake up during the night or wake up too early the next morning.</p>
					<p>There are many things that can cause sleep problems. Insomnia may be caused by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stress</li>
						<li>Depression or anxiety</li>
						<li>Stimulants</li>
						<li>Lack of regular exercise</li>
						<li>Changes in sleep surroundings or habits</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Insomnia is not a disease, and no test can diagnose it. But when you can't sleep well, it often has to do with some other cause. Treatment for insomnia focuses on the reason why you don't sleep well. If you have a medical problem, such as chronic pain, or an emotional problem, such as stress, treating that problem may help you sleep better.</p>
				<h4>Substance Abuse</h4>
					<p>Using drugs or alcohol in a way that harms you or that leads you to harm others, like your family or friends, is called substance use disorder. Someone with a substance use problem keeps using even though it causes problems in other parts of their life. People can have substance use problems with alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, and non-prescribed drugs.</p>
					<p>Using alcohol or drugs can affect your health, work, school, and relationships. You may be dependent on drugs if you physically or emotionally need drugs to get you through your day. You may not be aware that you have become dependent on a drug until you try to stop taking it.</p>
				<h4>ADHD</h4>
					<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition in which a person has trouble paying attention and focusing on tasks, tends to act without thinking, and has trouble sitting still. It may begin in early childhood and can continue into adulthood. There is no cure for ADHD, but treatment may help control the symptoms. Treatment may include medicines and behaviour therapy. Adults with ADHD may find it hard to focus, organize, and finish tasks. Adults may benefit from medicine combined with psychological support. This support includes education about the disorder, support groups and/or counselling, and skills training.</p>
					<p>Skills training may include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Time management training.</li>
						<li>Organizational techniques.</li>
						<li>Academic and vocational counselling.</li>
					</ul>

		<h3>Helping Others</h3>
			<p>The most important information we can convey to another human being is that we care and that they matter. A safe campus is a caring campus! If you believe someone you know is struggling, it’s okay to approach them. Often, people will appreciate you looking out for them, and they may need support during a hard time. Remember, it’s important to openly listen to the individual’s feelings in an understanding and caring way - even if they don’t accept help right away, it's good to show that you will be there if they want help in the future. You can use the following steps to approach someone who you are concerned about: </p>
		<h4>Approach</h4>
			<p>It's OK to ask during a one-on-one conversation and express concern. Be specific about the behaviour that concerns you:</p>
				<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
					<h5 class="alert-heading">Example:</h5>
						<p>I've noticed you've been absent from class lately and I'm concerned about you.</p>
				</div>
		<h4>Listen</h4>
			<p>Listen openly and non-judgmentally</p>
				<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
					<h5 class="alert-heading">Example:</h5>
						<p>Can you tell me more? Is there anything I can do to help you?</p>
				</div>
		<h4>Support</h4>
			<p>Acknowledge the person's thoughts and feelings in a compassionate way. Offer hope and reassure the student you are concerned and want to help.
			</p>
				<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
					<h5 class="alert-heading">Example:</h5>
						<p>It sounds like you are feeling out of place. You're not alone and we have resources to help.</p>
				</div>
		<h4>Refer</h4>
			<li>Provide person with resources </li>
			<li>Offer to make the call with the person</li>
			<li>If comfortable, walk with the person to a resource</li>
				<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
					<h5 class="alert-heading">Example:</h5>
						<p>Seeking help can feel scary but it's a sign of strength. If you'd like, I can call and connect you to a resource while you are here with me.</p>
				</div>
		<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
		<p>At Mount Royal, we also offer free suicide intervention training called <strong>Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR)</strong> which is a certified suicide prevention program. It supports people in learning to recognize signs of distress and builds awareness of suicide. <br>We want to create a strong campus where people are educated and aware of how to support others</p>
		</div>
		<h4>Policy and Harm Reduction</h4>
			<p>The Healthy Campus Team operates with a harm reduction lens, which means that our number one priority is keeping people in our campus community safe. It also means we recognize that some people are going to use substances like drugs and alcohol and we want to make sure everyone has the education and resources to be safe. We also provide information and support services to people who want to reduce or stop using substances.</p>
			<p>Less than half of Mount Royal students know where to go if they are concerned about their own, or a friend's, use of substances. Please visit or call Wellness Services for more information.</p>
		<h5>Cannabis</h5>
			<p>Did you know that cannabis has a variety of effects on your body from your brain, to your immune system, to your digestion? A lot of the effects can also differ depending on how you consume cannabis. If you do choose to use cannabis, keep these tips in mind to ensure you are staying safe in your consumption.</p>
			<p>Tips for safe cannabis usage:</p>
				<li><strong>Be safe.</strong> Use only in a safe place and with people who you know and trust.</li>
				<li><strong>Don't mix.</strong> Don't mix cannabis with alcohol or other drugs. This can make negative effects much worse. If you're taking prescription drugs, be honest with your doctor and talk about how cannabis may interact with your medication.</li>
				<li><strong>Never drive</strong> while using cannabis or for several hours after use.</li>
				<li><strong>Keep track.</strong> Monitor your use and be aware if you notice yourself using more frequently.</li>
				<li><strong>Be careful</strong> when you use. Cannabis impacts your ability to learn and memorize new information, so it's probably best to avoid before class or when you're trying to work on assignments.</li>
			<h6><br>Campus & Community Resources</h6>
				<p><a href="servicesCounselling.html">Wellness Services</a> - We have counsellors, mental health nurses, doctors, and psychiatrists that can help answer your questions about cannabis use, connect you to resources and give you tools to support others.</p>
