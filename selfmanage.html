      <h2>self-management & coping skills</h2>
      <p>Respecting yourself is an important part of good mental health. Try to remember that there is nothing to feel ashamed of if you are struggling. You can reach goals that are important to you even if you have a mental health problem. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help in these situations and remember that it is okay to use therapy and medication in order to live a more stable and happy life. Your mental health is just as important as health in the rest of your body. </p>
      <h1>Self-Management</h1>
		<p>Whenever you are having trouble with thinking negative thoughts, expecting the worst, or feeling powerless, try any of these exercises for a few days:</p>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Focus on what is going well</h4>
			<p>Write down three things that have gone well in the past day. These can be large, like getting a raise, or small, like "I talked with an old friend today." Describe the cause of each event, and credit yourself for the part you played in it, such as "I made that phone call I've been putting off for a long time."</p>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Practice gratitude</h4>
			<p>Write down three things in your life that you are grateful for. This kind of focus on what enriches your life can help keep your thoughts and feelings more positive</p>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Look for the benefits. </h4>
			<p>Think of a negative event from your near or distant past. Write it down. Now think of something positive that has or could come of it. Write it down. For the positive thought, use larger handwriting or a favourite colour.</p>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Look ahead</h4>
			<p>Picture yourself doing something that feels good. Expect good things to happen.</p>
		<h4 class="font-weight-bold">Build yourself up - do not be afraid to ask for help. </h4>
			<p>When you need it, lean on others or your faith to build more strength. Say to yourself often, "I am strong." If you feel you need someone to talk to immediately, visit chapter 3 | Crisis Resources of this document for mental health helplines, or talk with someone in your life that you trust.</p>
			<p>Your attitude and actions can influence what others think. Be honest with people and show them who you really are. When you help people understand your mental health problem, they are more likely to get past their negative views.</p>
			<p>Here are some ways you can help others better understand mental health problems:</p>
				<ul>				
					<li>Let them know that your mental health problem is a medical problem that can be treated.</li>
					<li>Talk about your recovery. This will help them understand the challenges you face.</li>
					<li>Show them your strengths and talents. Don't let your mental health problem keep you from going after things you want to do.</li>
					<li>Remember that "you are the message." You can show how you want to be treated by the way you act. Treating yourself with respect can set an example for everyone.</li>
					<li>Accept that you may need breaks during activities. Your symptoms may make it harder to focus on things for a long time.</li>
					<li>Work with your family and doctor to set goals you can reach. Let them know what changes you want to make in your life.</li>
